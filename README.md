# House-Price-Prediction
In the House Price Prediction project, multiple machine learning algorithms were assessed to identify the most accurate model for estimating property values. The models evaluated included K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and AdaBoost Regressor. These algorithms were trained on a dataset containing features such as latitude, longitude, house median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity. Their performance was compared based on prediction accuracy, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness of various machine learning approaches for real estate price estimation.
